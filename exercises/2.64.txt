a)
partial-tree divides a list's elements such that the median
(or element earlier for odd-numbered lists) becomes a tree
root, all elements less than that root form a tree as the root's
left branch, and all elements greater than the root become a
tree serving as the root's right branch. Its recursive tree
construction terminates when no elements are passed to it,
and it provides an empty list for the tree.

b)
The order of growth to convert an ordered list to a balanced
binary tree using partial-tree is THETA(n)
