Alyssa is correct. Her rewritten procedure would work.
But its process operates on numbers that grow to a^n,
which can be as large as (n-1)^n. For large n values this is highly impractical.

The fast prime tester ought to use the original expmod.
The original restricts factors by chaining remainder operations,
effectively limiting operands to (n-1)^2.
