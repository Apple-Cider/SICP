Eva is correct. Repeated computations against an uncertain number
compound the blurring effect the uncertainty has on the result. Reducing
the occurances of an uncertain number in an equation reduces its width's
modulation of the result. par2 has half the intervals in its computation
that par1 has, so it is more accurate.
