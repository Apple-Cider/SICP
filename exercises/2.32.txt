If defining the subsets of the empty set, the set only contains the empty set.
This is the base case.

All other cases can be defined inductively. If there is a set with n elements,
let the power set formed from all elements but the nth be called p-1. The power
set of the n elements can be formed by inserting the nth element into each set
of p-1, then appending p-1 to those sets.
