As stated, quotation allows typing in compound objects using the conventional
printed representation for lists. Thus (car (quote (a b c))) returns (without
evaulation) "a".
Written out, (car ''abracadabra) expands to (car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
The outer quote renders the inner quote and argument as a list, which car
procedes to pluck apart to retrieve that first list item, the special form
procedure quote.
