1.13 - {  } need to brush up on proofs
1.19 - {ip} need to struggle through using wicked math understandings
1.23 - {ip} root through all those given procedures to find aspects that 
            don't depend on the rate test-divisor is increased
1.28 - {ip} structure the expmod procedure to rely on identifying nontrivial
						square roots
1.38 - {ip} some bug; e given as 2.59817174187
														 not 2.71828182846
1.44 - {ip} figure out exactly what behavior is expected of a repetition of
						smoothing a function; do the values used to smooth an input's output
						themselves get smoothed? (that's the guess so far, but the impl does
						not perform that way yet)
2.16 - {ip} study up on algebraic expression simplification
2.57 - {ip} grappling with syntactic oddities concerning arbitrary argument passing
						and other issues *look into the apply procedure & make-product's logic
2.58 - {  } finish 2.57 first
2.65 - {ip} needs more hard thinking about lists and traversals and tree construction
