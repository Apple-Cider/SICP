With a pair-based representation of mobiles vs. the list approach,
only the selectors right-branch and branch-structure must be changed.

The list approach necessitates applying car to the cdr of the mobile
and branch because the cdr of those objcects is a 1-element list.

A pair approach would mean cdr extracts the elements directly, requiring
no car to access the data.

The list approach is more extensible, as additional attributes of branches
and mobiles may be added to their lists without disturbing the behavior of
the functions which use their current attributes.
